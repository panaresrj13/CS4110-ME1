In Alan Turing's book Computing Machinery and Intelligence, he asked the question "Can machines think?". I think machines can't think but only generate an answer if asked. They can generate answers since they are coded to answer that way. Artificial Intelligence or AI is named like that since artificial is man-made, so it means the intelligence of AI is made by humans themselves. The humans are the ones that feed information to the AI so they can answer the queries of the users. Therefore, even if Artificial Intelligence or AI can answer questions, it only responds because it is how they work or how they are coded.
